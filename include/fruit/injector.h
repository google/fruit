 * injector will also create and store the instances of classes that are needed (directly or indirectly) to inject the root types.
 * 
 * Example usage:
 * 
 * Injector<Foo, Bar> injector(getFooBarComponent());
 * Foo* foo = injector.get<Foo*>();
 * Bar* bar(injector); // Equivalent to: Bar* bar = injector.get<Bar*>();

   * (or even all), by processing the common bindings in advance, and then adding the ones that differ.
   * If most bindings differ, the use of NormalizedComponent and this constructor won't improve performance; in that case, use the

   * 
   * Note that a PartialComponent<...> can NOT be used as second argument, so if the second component is defined inline it must be
   * explicitly casted to the desired Component<...> type.
   * 
   * Example usage:
   * 
   * // In the global scope.
   * Component<Request> getRequestComponent(Request& request) {
   *   return fruit::createComponent()
   *       .bindInstance(request);

   * With a non-annotated parameter C, this returns a C*.
   * With an annotated parameter C=Annotated<Annotation, SomeClass>, this returns a const SomeClass*.
   * 
   * WARNING: Unlike get(), this method does not check that C is provided by this injector. In production code, always use get(),
   * so that you are guaranteed to catch missing bindings at compile time. This method might be useful in tests, since the
   * types exposed by each component are determined by the needs of the production code, not of the test code.
   * Also, this is slightly slower than get(), but as long as it's only used in test code the difference should not be noticeable.
   * 
   * Note that this doesn't trigger auto-bindings: so even if the constructor of C was visible to some get*Component function (or
   * to the place where unsafeGet is called), in order to successfully get an instance with this method you need all the
   * following to be true:
   * * C was explicitly bound in a component, or C was a dependency (direct or indirect) of a type that was explicitly bound
   * * C was not bound to any interface (note however that if C was bound to I, you can do unsafeGet<I>() instead).
   * Otherwise this method will return nullptr.
   * 
   * WARNING: This method depends on what types are bound internally. It's not too unlikely that the internal bindings might
   * change in a future version of Fruit (it already happened between 1.0 and 1.1). If this happens, it will be in the release
   * notes, and if you used this method you'll have to check that the existing uses still work.
